# Cannvas

## About This Project  

Cannvas is an ecommerce website where users can purchase goods & services that are based around the cannabis plant, hemp. This project was created to bring awareness to the world about the variety of things that can be done with this plant, & to educate the masses on all of the benefits it posses. Users will be able to sign in & sign up to an account, save personal information & edit their profile, browse through items & amenities, view details on everything the website has to offer, add items to a shopping cart & view the details of that cart, update the content in the cart, checkout & purchase everything in the cart using various forms of payment(credit/debit, Google/Appple Pay, PayPal, giftcards), track their order, contact the seller(s) & request refunds or cancel any order, & rate the product, service, or seller. Our community will also have the ability to sign up for an admin account which will allow them to sell their website approved goods & services through our platform. Admins will be able to set prices & details on what they offer, update said item/service, track revenue, costs, & profits, send updates on their customers' shippments, issue refudns or cancelations, & rate the customer(only viewable by other admins). Cannvas will handle shipping to the customers & storing the admins' products to be shipped, sending out shipping labels for returns, & recieving returns to be processed, sent back to admin, or resold.
